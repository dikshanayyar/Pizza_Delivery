# Pizza_Delivery
The Pizza Delivery project is an innovative web application that simplifies the process of ordering and delivering pizzas.
Here's a description of what I do in this project:
Order Placement: I can help customers place their pizza orders by providing them with a menu, describing available toppings, suggesting popular combinations, and taking their order details, such as size, crust type, and toppings preferences.
Address Verification: I can assist in verifying and confirming the customer's delivery address to ensure accurate and timely delivery. This may involve asking for specific details, such as the street name, building number, or any additional landmarks, to avoid any confusion.
The technologies I have used in this  project, including ASP.NET, C#, and SQL, are commonly employed in web development and database management.
